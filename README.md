# where2go

A collaborative guide and resource repository for learning and developing web applications with Go.

## Introduction

"where2go" is a learning path that guides you from the basics of Go through to developing and deploying robust web applications. This is not a linear journey; expect to jump between hands-on projects and learning materials, reinforcing concepts along the way.

## Getting Started

- Begin with ["A Tour of Go"](https://tour.golang.org) on the official go.dev website.
- Speed read through "For the Love of Go"
- After grounding yourself in basics, advance to the Practical Go course offered by Ardan Labs.
- 

> ðŸ’¡ _Remember: Iterate between doing projects and reading material. It would feel circular in the beginning._

### Foundational Concepts

- Master the use of CURL for interacting with web servers.
- Understand HTTP response codes and the basics of how HTTP works.
- Practice reading and interpreting responses in the terminal.

### Development Environment Setup

#### Tools

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Zsh (Z Shell)](https://www.zsh.org/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/)
- [Vim](https://www.vim.org/)

#### Hygiene Practices

- GoW
- Makefiles

> ðŸ’¡ _Avoid relying on AI coding tools in the initial stages to strengthen your foundational understanding._

## Project Ideas

### Starter Web Project

1. Create a simple HTTP server that responds with "Hello World" when visited.
   - _Hint: Use CURL to interact with your server._
2. Extend the server to request and respond with the user's name.
3. Implement session saving in a database, such as SQLite3.
4. [A more compelte web app project]

> ðŸ’¡ _Iterative project development is key to solidifying your learning._

## Level Up

- Explore using web-app starter templates that include middleware, such as those from MagicBell or Huma.
- Dive into [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).
- Host your application on [Render.com](https://render.com/).
